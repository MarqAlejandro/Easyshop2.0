# Easyshop2.0

 ## Description

 This Application Program Interface (API) is a connector program that bridges a back-end SQL database with a front-end HTML User Interface (UI),
 that not only allows the user to browse a store's entire inventory, but also add products to an online cart and make a purchase.  

 ## Features

 The UI storefront has many interactables for the users:
 - a button for logging into an account
 - a combo box for filtering through Categories
 - 2 price sliders to filter by a price range
 - a combo box to filter by color
