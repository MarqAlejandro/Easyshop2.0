# Easyshop2.0

 ## Description

 This Application Program Interface (API) is a connector program that bridges a back-end SQL database with a front-end HTML User Interface (UI),
 that not only allows the user to browse a store's entire inventory, but also add products to an online cart and make a purchase.  

 ## Features

 The UI storefront has many interactables for the users:
 - a button for logging into an account
 - a combo box for filtering through Categories
 - 2 price sliders to filter by a price range
 - a combo box to filter by color


## Screenshots of output/progression

 ### This is a screenshot of the Home Screen menu with working Categories
 - Upon launch of the site, there was a notice saying that "Categories failed to load" which was my first fix.
 - - Fixed the issue by developing the Category-related classes and made sure they connect to the database.

 ### The price sliders before the fix.
 Users have reported that the product search functionality is returning incorrect results.
 Found the issue in not only the HTML, but also the API. 
 Not only was the HTML displaying 2 "Minimum Price" sliders, but also the API wasn't using max price.

 ### This is a screenshot of the price sliders after the fix.
 I made sure the HTML reflected the proper labels, 
 and made sure that the logic would create a proper price range.
